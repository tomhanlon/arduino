# Arduino 

## Morse Code

Stuck in the middle of nowhere with a powered laptop, an internet connection, an Arduino w/ breadboard, one 330 OHM resistor, two power cables, one cable to provide the signal from Arduino to breadboard and a tiny-ass LED light? You're in luck. Clone down this .ino file and you'll have everything you need to signal "SOS" in morse code.
